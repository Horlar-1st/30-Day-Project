# 30 Days of Python

A repository showcasing 30 days of Python projects to build discipline, accountability, and Python coding skills through one structured problem per day, each day with a new challenge and difficulty progresses weekly. The project details can be found in the `projects.pdf` file.

## Project Details
The `projects.pdf` file contains the project descriptions, requirements, and solutions for each day. The projects are designed to test and improve Python skills in various areas, such as:

* Data structures and algorithms
* File input/output and persistence
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

* `projects.pdf`: Contains the project details and descriptions.
* Code files for each project will be added as they are completed.

## Goals
The goals of this repository are:

* **Improve Python skills**: Through consistent practice and solving real-world problems.
* **Showcase problem-solving abilities**: By providing solutions to each project.
* **Build a portfolio of projects**: To demonstrate Python skills to potential employers or collaborators.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies are used in this repository:

* **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for all projects.
* **Various libraries and frameworks**: Depending on the project requirements. The library used include `gradio`, `time`, `random`, `regex`, `json`, etc
